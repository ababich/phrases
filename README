=== Technical requirements

App was build using:

Rails 2.3.5
Ruby 1.8.7 (2009-06-12 patchlevel 174) [universal-darwin10.0]
Gem 1.3.7


The only additional gem is AuthLogic, it is noted as config.gem requirement, so just run

sudo rake gems:install

to install AuthLogic if you do not have one


=== Setup

Copy DB settings

cp config/database.yml.example to config/database.yml

and edit according to your config

then you can run

rake db:create
rake db:rebuild #custom task which makes drop-create-migrate-seed sequence

NOTE: seed.rb contains only limited amount of preloaded languges not to bloat DB, but if you want to
add more - do it in seed.rb in case App has no admin UI
